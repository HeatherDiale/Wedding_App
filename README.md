# Wedding_App
Wedding Planning App for Professional Planners:

From my recent experience working with a wedding planner for my own wedding, it was quickly obvious that wedding planners could benefit from an app that could organize all the many details that go into a wedding, for all their weddings. 

Key features of website:

Planners can keep each wedding plan separated but easily exchangeable

Planners and their clients can add tasks to complete (email notified of approaching date)

Wedding budget tool can be accessed/ edited by both parties. 

Editable guest list that tracks/sorts by details ( address, # attending, meal option, etc..)

Shared images can be saved/sorted into categories

Vendors have brief profiles, allowing clients to make side by side comparisons
